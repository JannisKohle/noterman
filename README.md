# noterman

noterman is a command line interface for quickly writing & checking small notes.
I'm planing to implement this in Python, and in C.

## What noterman can do:

With noterman, you can create, change and delete notes. Every note has a uid which
is used for deleting and changing notes.These notes can have tags, like ```school```
and ```programming```.

## Usage:

- Create a new note: ```noterman add```
- Change a note: ```noterman change 438```
- Delete a note: ```noterman delete 196```
